# Questions

1. What (if any) further additions would you like to make to your submission, if you had
more time?
2. Is there anything you would change about your current implementation?

1. If I had more time, I'd like implementing episode's API, and adding login signup using firebase.
2. I wouldn't change anything. Just if it was a big project, I would be using combine-swiftui making asynchronous calls with that.
